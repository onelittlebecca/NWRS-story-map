# NWRS-story-map

This interactive story map highlights several conservation projects that fall under the Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy (SECAS).  This project is under active development.

## Development

To ease development we use npm scripts to compile JS with browserify/watchify, compile sass to css, optimize images, etc:

First, install the project dependencies:

`npm install`

To kick off the development server and all pre-requisite tasks:

`npm start`

The `dist` folder is the directory used to serve the app.

To build a production ready version of the app use:

`npm run build`

The optimized application is built into the `dist` folder, which you can copy onto your web server.

To publish a production ready demo to GitHub Pages:

`npm run publish:demo`

To visualize packages contributing to bundle file size:

`npm run inspect:bundle`

This task can help you uncover modules that are bloating your final javascript bundle size.

### Tasks

#### Images

Any image in the `app/images/project-photos` directory will be resized to create a 175px x 125px thumbnail image, which is used in the image gallery at the bottom of the screen and a 500px wide image for the infowindow that appears on the right side.  These files are copied to `dist/images/photos` for consumption by the application.  You can change the sizes of these images by editing `build/resize-images.js`.  This task includes a file watcher; any time you add a new image it will automatically run.

#### SVG

This task watches the `app/images/markers/` directory for any `svg` file.  It optimizes the svg using imagemin and imagemin-svgo.  Files are copied to `dist/images` for use in the application.  Any time you add a new svg this task will automatically run.

#### Project Data

Project data is stored as GeoJSON in the `app/data` directory.  One file represents the tabular data neccessary (stored in a Google sheet, downloaded as an CSV, converted to GeoJSON) to display markers on the map.  The other file represents the area of interest associated with that marker displayed as a polygon.  Both of these files are watched by the `npm start` task and minified to reduce file size.
